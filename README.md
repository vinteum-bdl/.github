This is a special repository whose sole purpose is to hold a `profile/README.md`
that that GitHub will then display in the organization front page. See the
[GitHub
docs](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile#adding-a-member-only-organization-profile-readme)
for more information.
